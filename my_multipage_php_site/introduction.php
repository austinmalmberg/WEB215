    <h2>Personal Background</h2>
    
    <p>I live in Denver (No, not Colorado) and I've been working at CPCC since 2008.</p>

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>
    
    <p>I started part-time at CPCC in the ITS Help Desk answering phones.  From there, I was hired full-time around 2012 where I now assist with inventory management and ITS procurement.</p>

    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    
    <p>I've taken tons of random classes over the years, but currently pursuing degrees in Software Development and Full Stack Programming.</p>

    <h2>Primary Computer Platform</h2>
    
    <p>I use a Windows desktop for school.</p>

    <h2>Courses</h2>
    
    <ul class="nested-list">
      
      <li><b>WEB 215:</b> Ready to learn some more JavaScript!</li>
      
      <li><b>CTI 289:</b> Final class before getting my Software Development degree!</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Remember Me</h2>
    
    <p>Back before cell phones were around and there was usually only a single computer per household, I wrote a batch file to restart my computer. Being the "1337 hacker" I thought I was, I immediately copied it to the Startup folder, restarted the computer manually, and then scrambled frantically for about 30 minutes to fix the boot loop I had created before my brother got home and found out.</p>
