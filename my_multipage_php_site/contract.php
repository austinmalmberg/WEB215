  <h2>WEB215-85 - Course Contract</h2>

    <p>I, <b>Austin Malmberg</b>, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my <b>2019 SP WEB215-85 Advanced Markup &amp; Scripting</b> with my instructor, <b>D.I. von Briesen</b>.</p>

    <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

    <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

    <p>Signed: <span class="highlighted">Austin C. Malmberg, January 13, 2019</span></p>
